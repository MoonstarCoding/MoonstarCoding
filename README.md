# Mark Hutchison

I am a male (he/him) University student, with a lot of Web Developement Experience, and an amazing coder who has experience with coding in just some of the following languages:

- HTML
- SCSS, CSS
- JavaScript, jQuery, TypeScript
- PHP
- Python3
- GoLang
- C++, C
- Java
- Assembly (NASM and RISC-V)
- Bash Scripting
- mySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB for Databasing

âš¡ Fun fact: I was a part of the Skills Canada Web Design and Development competition and placed Bronze, so it is safe to say that you can trust me when I say I know what I am talking about. Feel free to ask me about the experience, because man do I have stories!

## Jazzmoon

In high school, my friend [BowsiePup](https://github.com/BowsiePup) and I started (Jazzmoon)[https://github.com/Jazzmoon]. It was meant to be a small freelance company that did coding jobs and web development related tasks. However, since we lived in such a small town, business wasn't great. That being said, whenever we make anything together, we release it as (Jazzmoon)[https://github.com/Jazzmoon] since that identity is our identity as a team.
